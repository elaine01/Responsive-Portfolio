						Hello! Thanks for visiting my page, my very first time coding a site from scratch! Please feel free to take a look around. It's still a work in progress- will be updating the portfolio page with each project I finish so hope to see you back soon!
					</p>
					<p>
						A Bay Area native, I've ventured off south for school in San Diego and migrated to Seoul, South Korea for work in the entertainment industry. I'm now back at my roots in the heart of tech, and... it's good to be home. Home sweet home.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you meet me, you'll probably take note of some food nearby. Like a rabbit, I like to nibble on food throughout the day. Music is my caffiene, and Korean dramas are my junk food. But, I watch them without subtitles in Korean so it's more like healthy food, right? Right... Oh, does knowing coding make me trilingual? Hmm.
					</p>
					<p>
						Sudoku and Two Dots are my jams, and I'm always on a quest for some yummy protein. By the way, Stackoverflow is starting to become my new best friend... this is just the beginning to a beautiful friendship.
					</p>
